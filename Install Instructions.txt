Simple, you see that folder called Weapons Unleashed?

Just slap that in AppData\Local\KillHouseGames\DoorKickers2\mods

If you are having trouble navigating to it, Press your Start Button and try typing %localappdata%
It should open a folder that will contain a bunch of nonsense, From there Find "KillHouseGames" then "DoorKickers2" then "mods" Boom You got it.

Good job buddy.

Alternatively I have included an Installer, It should do the trick but you can always manually install it if you don't trust my Bat, No sweat it definitely doesn't hurt my feelings T^T.

If you have issues Ping me in the Mod discussion channel on the DoorKickers 2 Discord.
Or if you want to DM me Fluffy#3105
