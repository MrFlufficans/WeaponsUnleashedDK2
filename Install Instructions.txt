Simple, you see that folder called Weapons Unleashed?

Just slap that in AppData\Local\KillHouseGames\DoorKickers2\mods

If you are having trouble navigating to it, Press your Start Button and try typing %localappdata%
It should open a folder that will contain a bunch of nonsense, From there Find "KillHouseGames" then "DoorKickers2" then "mods" Boom You got it.

Good job buddy.

If you have issues Ping me in the Mod discussion channel on the DoorKickers 2 Discord.
Or if you want to DM me Fluffy#3105
